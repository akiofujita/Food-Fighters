===

Navigating to the index page for the API will yield a RESTplus documentation of the API calls. This is generated using the library restx and will be kept up to date. The documentation for restx can be found at <https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

.. note::
    
    Additional API information will be listed and linked here. For now, additional documentation can be found in code via restplus.
