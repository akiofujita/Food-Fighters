        Cooking is a constant battle between brainstorming what to cook and what ingredients you happen to have in the fridge/pantry at the time.
        Everything we buy at the grocery store vary in portions, and itâ€™s easy to be left with an excess of ingredients.
        Particularly for busy college students, preparing ingredients and cooking them in a timely manner is also a large concern.
        We hope to create something that will lessen this burden so that people can quickly figure out what to make in a timely manner and eventually shop efficiently as well.
